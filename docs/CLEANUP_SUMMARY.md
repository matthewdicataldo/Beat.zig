# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed comprehensive repository cleanup and organization for Beat.zig v3.1, implementing proper project structure and artifact management.

## Changes Made

### 1. **File Organization**

**Moved to `artifacts/` directory:**
- All LLVM IR files (`beat_souper_*.ll`, `beat_souper_*.bc`)
- Compiled library artifacts (`lib*.a`, `lib*.a.o`)
- Souper setup logs and progress files
- Stray executable files

**Moved to `examples/` directory:**
- Demo and analysis files (`*_demo.zig`, `*_analysis.zig`)
- Profile and test utilities
- ML integration examples
- Souper test cases (organized in `examples/souper_tests/`)

**Moved to `docs/archive/` directory:**
- Legacy documentation (integration guides, roadmaps)
- Historical analysis reports
- Original Souper design document (`sopuer!.md`)
- Archived examples file with outdated API

### 2. **Updated .gitignore**

Added comprehensive patterns for:
- Souper artifacts (`*.ll`, `*.bc`, `souper_*`)
- LLVM build artifacts (`*.ninja_deps`, `*.ninja_log`)
- Temporary files and logs
- Third-party build directories

### 3. **Documentation Updates**

**Created:**
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Comprehensive repository organization guide
- `docs/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

**Updated:**
- `README.md` - Added repository structure section, updated feature list
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with artifact organization notes
- `tasks.md` - Added Souper completion task tracking

**Reorganized:**
- Moved Souper integration docs to `docs/` directory
- Archived outdated documentation to preserve history

### 4. **Build System Validation**

**Verified working functionality:**
- ✅ Core tests pass (`zig build test`)
- ✅ All build targets functional
- ✅ Modular and bundle imports working
- ✅ Build system artifact generation properly organized

**Fixed issues:**
- Updated legacy `examples.zig` import references
- Archived outdated API examples
- Verified clean build process
