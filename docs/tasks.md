#### Expected Performance Impact

Based on research analysis, continuation stealing implementation is expected to provide:

- **Stack Switching Overhead**: 40-60% reduction compared to child stealing
- **Memory Allocation Efficiency**: Bounded O(P) space vs unbounded in current approach
- **Cache Locality**: 15-25% improvement through execution order preservation  
- **Scalability**: Better scaling characteristics on 8+ core systems
- **Combined with Beat.zig optimizations**: Potentially 20-40% additional performance improvement

#### Implementation Priority

**High Priority** (Phase 7.1): Foundation mechanisms that provide immediate benefits
**Medium Priority** (Phase 7.2): Advanced stealing strategies for optimal performance
**Research Priority** (Phase 7.3-7.4): Integration with existing optimizations and validation

This implementation builds upon Beat.zig's existing ultra-optimized foundation while adding continuation stealing as a complementary optimization strategy. The design leverages existing topology awareness, SIMD acceleration, and predictive scheduling infrastructure.
