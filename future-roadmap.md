# ZigPulse Future Roadmap

## Vision
ZigPulse aims to become the premier parallelism library for Zig, offering best-in-class performance, ergonomics, and platform support. Our goal is to make parallel programming as natural and efficient as serial programming.

## Areas to Explore

### Predictive Task Scheduling ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Goal**: Reduce scheduling overhead by predicting task execution times
- **Implementation**:
  - Task fingerprinting based on call site and data patterns
  - 1‚Ç¨ filter for adaptive execution time tracking (better than EMA for variable workloads)
    - See analysis: [PREDICTIVE_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md](docs/PREDICTIVE_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md)
  - Confidence-based scheduling decisions
  - Integration with existing heartbeat scheduler
- **Expected Impact**: 20-30% reduction in scheduling overhead
