# ZigPulse Future Roadmap

## Vision
ZigPulse aims to become the premier parallelism library for Zig, offering best-in-class performance, ergonomics, and platform support. Our goal is to make parallel programming as natural and efficient as serial programming.

## Areas to Explore

### Predictive Task Scheduling ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Goal**: Reduce scheduling overhead by predicting task execution times
- **Implementation**:
  - Task fingerprinting based on call site and data patterns
  - 1‚Ç¨ filter for adaptive execution time tracking (better than EMA for variable workloads)
    - See analysis: [PREDICTIVE_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md](docs/PREDICTIVE_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md)
  - Confidence-based scheduling decisions
  - Integration with existing heartbeat scheduler
- **Expected Impact**: 20-30% reduction in scheduling overhead

### Continuation Stealing üîÑ
- **Goal**: More efficient work-stealing with superior memory characteristics vs child stealing
- **Background**: 
  - Continuation stealing (used in Cilk) vs child stealing (used in TBB, OpenMP, TPL)
  - In continuation stealing, the continuation after a spawned task is made available for theft
  - Child stealing makes spawned child tasks available for theft instead
- **Key Advantages**:
  - **Memory Efficiency**: Stack allocation for continuations vs dynamic allocation for child tasks
  - **Reduced Stack Switches**: No stack switch needed when continuation isn't stolen (common case)
  - **Bounded Space**: O(P) space complexity vs potentially unbounded in child stealing
  - **Better Cache Locality**: Preserves serial execution order when no theft occurs
- **Implementation Challenges**:
  - Requires compiler support for continuation capture
  - Complex stack frame management 
  - Integration with Zig's execution model
  - Handling of error propagation across stolen continuations
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Extend current Chase-Lev deque to store continuations instead of tasks
  - Implement continuation capture mechanism in Zig
  - Stack-allocated continuation frames with proper lifetime management
  - Synchronization via join counters for spawned work completion
- **Expected Impact**: 15-25% reduction in scheduling overhead vs current child-stealing approach
- **Research Sources**:
  - Cilk work-stealing implementation papers
  - Intel Cilk Plus runtime analysis
  - Comparative studies of continuation vs child stealing performance

### GPU Task Offloading via SYCL üéÆ
- **Goal**: Transparent GPU acceleration for suitable workloads
- **Implementation**:
  - SYCL-based unified programming model (single backend, multiple vendors)
  - C FFI wrapper for SYCL integration with Zig
  - Automatic task classification for GPU suitability
  - Host-device memory management via SYCL buffers/USM
  - Hybrid CPU-GPU scheduling with work queues
  - See: [SYCL with Zig Guide.md](docs/SYCL%20with%20Zig%20Guide.md)
- **Expected Impact**: 10-100x speedup for data-parallel tasks

### Hardware Transactional Memory üîí
- **Goal**: Eliminate locking overhead in critical paths
- **Implementation**:
  - Intel TSX / ARM TME support
  - Fallback to lock-free algorithms
  - Adaptive retry policies
  - Conflict detection and resolution
- **Expected Impact**: 50% reduction in synchronization overhead

### SIMD Task Processing üöÄ
- **Goal**: Process multiple small tasks simultaneously
- **Implementation**:
  - Task batching for SIMD execution
  - Auto-vectorization of compatible tasks
  - Platform-specific optimizations (AVX-512, SVE)
  - Compiler hints for vectorization
- **Expected Impact**: 4-8x throughput for small tasks

### Machine Learning Integration üß†
- **Goal**: Self-tuning parallelism based on workload patterns
- **Implementation**:
  - Online learning for task classification
  - Reinforcement learning for scheduling policies
  - Anomaly detection for performance issues
  - Predictive resource allocation
- **Expected Impact**: Automatic optimal performance

### Formal Verification üìê
- **Goal**: Prove correctness of lock-free algorithms
- **Implementation**:
  - LLM-assisted proof development with Lean 4 + LLMLean
  - DeepSeek-Prover-V2 for subgoal decomposition
  - Limited o3-pro usage for complex proofs
  - Automated CI/CD verification pipeline
  - See: [FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md](docs/FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md)
- **Deliverable**: Mathematically proven correct implementation

### Energy-Aware Scheduling üîã
- **Goal**: Optimize for performance per watt
- **Implementation**:
  - CPU frequency scaling integration
  - Core parking strategies
  - Thermal-aware scheduling
  - Battery life optimization modes
- **Target**: 30% energy reduction with <5% performance impact
